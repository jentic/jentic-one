"""Broker domain-exception taxonomy + the agent-recovery contract.

Pure module — **no** FastAPI/httpx/DB imports. Core/services/adapters raise these
typed domain exceptions; the single FastAPI handler in ``broker/web/errors.py``
maps the taxonomy to ``application/problem+json`` (the B-004 handler). This keeps
the transport coupling out of the domain/service layers (00-overview "Errors —
domain in, problem+json out").

Every error also carries the **agent-recovery contract**: an ``error_origin``
(``broker`` | ``upstream``) and, where a deterministic recovery exists, a
structured ``AgentDirective`` so the autonomous-agent caller can recover without
reading docs (02-core-proxy "Agent-centric error recovery").
